# Topic-Modeling-with-LDA-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-using-python

Topic Modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
Overview

This code demonstrates how to perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a small text dataset. The code tokenizes, preprocesses, and analyzes the text data to identify main topics within the documents. It also extracts and prints the main topic of a new document and lists documents associated with that topic.
Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Gensim: A library for topic modeling.
    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for text preprocessing and stopword removal.

Process Flow

    Import Necessary Libraries:
        Import the required libraries, including Gensim, NLTK, and others.

    Install NLTK Resources:
        Ensure that the NLTK library is installed and download necessary resources using the nltk.download() function. In this code, resources such as "punkt," "stopwords," and "wordnet" are downloaded.

    Sample Text Data:
        Define a sample dataset containing text documents. You can replace this with your own dataset.

    Text Preprocessing:
        Define functions for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
        Apply these preprocessing steps to the documents.

    Create a Dictionary and Document-Term Matrix:
        Create a dictionary of terms and a document-term matrix to convert text data into a numerical format suitable for topic modeling.

    Build the LDA Model:
        Specify the number of topics you want to identify.
        Train an LDA model using the document-term matrix, dictionary, and the chosen number of topics.

    Print Topics and Top Words:
        Print the topics discovered by the LDA model and their associated top words.

    Get Main Topic of a New Document:
        Define a function to identify the main topic of a new document.
        Tokenize, preprocess, and convert the new document into a bag-of-words (BoW) representation.
        Calculate the topic distribution for the new document using the LDA model.
        Select the topic with the highest probability as the main topic.

    Get Documents Associated with the Main Topic:
        Define a function to retrieve documents associated with a given topic.
        For each document in the dataset, calculate its topic distribution using the LDA model.
        Find the topic with the highest probability for each document and compare it to the main topic.
        List the documents that are associated with the main topic.

    Inference on a New Document:
        Provide a new document for inference.
        Extract and print the main topic and its probability for the new document.
        List documents in the dataset that are associated with the main topic.

Usage

    Replace the documents variable with your own text dataset in the code.
    Ensure that the code is adapted to your specific language (e.g., replacing English text with Bengali text) and stopwords.
    Run the code to perform topic modeling and identify the main topic of a new document.

Notes

    This code is a simplified example and is meant to be used as a starting point for topic modeling with LDA.
    For more meaningful results, use a larger and more diverse dataset.
    Fine-tuning the model and preprocessing steps may be necessary for real-world applications.
